Use this template for full-stack data-driven applications that need type-safe API calls between frontend and backend.

Best for:
- Dashboards and admin panels
- Storefronts and marketplaces
- Data-heavy CRUD applications
- Apps that query a D1 database

Includes: React 18, TanStack Router (file-based), TanStack Query, tRPC for end-to-end type safety, Cloudflare Workers + D1, 50+ shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS with 3 color themes, dark mode support.

The tRPC setup means you define procedures once in the worker and get fully typed React hooks automatically -- no separate API client needed.
